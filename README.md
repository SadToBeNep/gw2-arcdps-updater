# gw2-arcdps-updater
A python script to keep GW2 ArcDPS updated

Usage:\
Move the script, or the script-to-exe converted executable into the Guild Wars 2 installation folder\
Create a file named: gw_up.conf\
Write the full path of the Guild Wars 2 installation folder into that file, for me it is: C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2\
From this point the script will take care of everything else, this is for my use only, was uploaded to github because I am lazy to store it anywhere else, and git is that easy to use...\
\
As for converting the script into an exe, I recommend auto-py-to-exe or the already built exe, if you are suspicious about it having something fishy coded into it, build it yourself\
